You are the oldest
Stockbroker in the city
Living off rice cakes

Your dream was bottled
You caught the marketplace blues
She caught paperwork

The day you closed down
She struggled to buy children
Everything was lunch

Half a minute late
Steam from her broken kettle
Compels a divorce

Delegalising
Unsatisfactorily
Irretrievable

Striptease after work
Slowly turning inside out
Drive home car mishap

Hospital beauty
Your chatting up failing now
Embarrassing death

Back in the workplace
New roles new woman for new
Oldest stockbroker
