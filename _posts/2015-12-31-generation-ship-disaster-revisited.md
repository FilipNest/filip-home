description: A space musical with 16 voices 

---

In 2008 Generation Ship Disaster was a collection of mostly instrumental music.

In 2012 a story was thought up for it, with the aim of being read over the original, unedited tracks in the same order and with the same titles as they were originally given.

This story was finally put into writing in December 2015, and with the help of 16 wonderful volunteers, was narrated over the top of the original music.

It was released on the 31st of December 2015 as part of a 2015 challenge to finally finish an art project started long ago every month.
