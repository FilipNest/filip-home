__Our block has a power cut tonight (7th Jan, 2019). I got out my guitar and wrote this. Was going to record it but using my laptop battery and phone to post this is already cheating. In other related news it's quite exciting watching the people work on it outside. They have big reflective jackets on them that say "electricity" in big letters. It feels kinda sci-fi.__

Get yourself some things that work,
Without a power supply.
Don't fade out like a battery, switched off prepared to die.
Sitting in the dark with a slab of metal as the stars light up the sky.
Get yourself some things that work,
Without a power supply.

Get yourself some things that work,
Without a lover or a friend.
Playing chess with just yourself always kills you in the end
Explore without a mirror, burn the mail you'll never send.
Get yourself some things that work,
Without a lover or a friend.

Everyone said you can fix your heart with electricity,
But I watched the sparks fizzle away the light inside of me.
It's the current situation, it's not where you want to be,
That power cut you're dreading's called an opportunity.

Get yourself some things that work,
Without a power supply.
Don't fade out like a battery, switched off prepared to die.
Sitting in the dark with a slab of metal as the stars light up the sky.
Get yourself some things that work,
Without a power supply.
