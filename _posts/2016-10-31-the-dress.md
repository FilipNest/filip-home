A concept EP about a killer dress.

Thanks to the good friend who told me the story that made this very fic­ti­tious story hap­pen (also apo­lo­gies to Eur­ip­ides, Mendels­sohn, Wag­ner…). Typ­ical low-fi home re­cord­ing. Cover art via vec­tors by: San­ti­ago Arias, Cre­at­ive Stall, Manos Hatzida­kis, Freepic.

Writ­ten and re­cor­ded dur­ing the last three days of Oc­to­ber at Stu­dio Josephine, Ab­bey Road, St John’s Wood.
