## Two first kisses

Shaking off a darkness,
Switching on the light.
Two first kisses,
One of them felt right.

Smiling at eachother,
WIll a crush become a lover?
By the swimming pool as the whistle blows you out.
Cheers, but you've no ears for any other one the day is done,
but look at all the better days to come.

Dreaming of me with you.
You're dreaming of you with me.
There's a space for both our heads on either of our beds.
And what a dream the both of us would be.

Shaking off a darkness,
Switching on the light.
Two first kisses,
One of them felt right.
