Your voice was everywhere today.
Ringing through phones, living rooms.
Impossible to ignore.

All over stories of stage-shows and plans for tomorrow.

Rising up the charts in a comeback,
But you donâ€™t.

Still as lips echo yours exactly,
You'll outlast most of us.
Breathing out only
but between headphones in a carriage,
a night watching an old film with friends,
an alleyway you haunt to clear out lesser ghosts for a dancer's steps.
Your voice is everywhere.
Breaths held for you 
And you can sing forever.
