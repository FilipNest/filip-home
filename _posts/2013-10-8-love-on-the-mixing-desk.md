I had a love on the mix­ing desk,
But it panned out wrong.
We got lost to the room.
Be­fore the second song.

I mon­itored our pro­gress,
And our heart-beat’s lost for good.
I tried to say I’m sorry,
But nobody un­der­stood,

Be­cause they could­n’t hear.
Our mes­sage was­n’t clear in the room any­more.

It pops and clicks to­gether
When I turn to you and shout.
Can you hear it loud and clear?
When I check-check-check you out.

I tried re-chan­nel­ling our hearts,
Un­til we’re side by side again.
I grabbed the parts you liked,
And I turned them up to ten.

We were al­most equal,
Un­til we star­ted to peak
we’ll never mas­ter what we’ve done.
…

I thought we were a good mix.
But our light’s been turn­ing red.
I tried to pull a quick fix,
But I cut the sig­nal dead.

I get a nervous twitch,
While you ini­ti­ate a sob.
All your emo­tions switch,
While I’m act­ing like a knob.

I’m hav­ing treble get­ting down,
Then I see it start to fade,
I’m still hanging round this town.
After the band’s already played.

It was love on the mix­ing desk.
But it panned out wrong.
We got lost to the room.
Be­fore the second song.
