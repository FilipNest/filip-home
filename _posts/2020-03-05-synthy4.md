description: A collaborative, multiplayer synthesiser with colours

---

The fourth installment of my Synthy range of multiplayer colour synthesisers. Synthy 2 and Synthy 3 happened but never got to complete state. This is therefore probably the truest sequel to the original Synthy in 2020.

Anil Dash of Glitch liked it: "This is so charming. And an amazing way to show off how the web is a much richer creative medium than we think â€” real-time multi-person collaboration on a synth/sequencer!"
