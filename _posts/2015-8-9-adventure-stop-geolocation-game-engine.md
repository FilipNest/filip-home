A System for Making, Hosting and Experiencing Geolocated Adventures & Art

Ad­ven­ture Stop lets you cre­ate ad­ven­tures and art­works that de­pend on where a per­son is in the world. A scav­enger hunt? A video you can only watch in one place? A ad­ven­ture game com­plete with gold and dragons? This was cre­ated for those sorts of things.
