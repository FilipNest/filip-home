Here are three snippets that I stumbled across long after they were recorded that I feel work well together. They’re from around 2010 recorded in Welwyn Garden City though I have no idea when the last track was recorded.

I tend to go for a “re­lease everything” method with mu­sic but oc­ca­sion­ally things get left out. In other cases they don’t really fit on a col­lec­tion so hang around as singles un­til be­ing bur­ied some­where on a hard drive.

Here are three snip­pets that I stumbled across long after they were re­cor­ded that I feel work well to­gether. They’re from around 2010 re­cor­ded in Wel­wyn Garden City though I have no idea when the last track was re­cor­ded. I hope it’s by me. Vo­cals on “There’s a Choir!” by Lind­say Phil­lips.

I think I was think­ing of re­mix­ing them and us­ing them for something but will leave them as is for you to, I hope, en­joy.
