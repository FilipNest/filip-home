Here are three tracks found on a hard drive from around 2009. It was around the time I made a hip hop EP with my wonderfully talented friend Daniel Cooper (performing vocals as Pressurefairy at the time), but these are instrumentals.

Fol­low­ing on from put­ting a col­lec­tion of re­cord­ings I made but never really did any­thing with on here week or so ago, here are three other tracks from around 2009. It was around the time I made a hip hop EP with my won­der­fully tal­en­ted friend Daniel Cooper (per­form­ing vo­cals as Pres­sure­fairy at the time), but these are in­stru­ment­als.

The first track is pretty much just a beat but it has some fun synth whir­ing at the end, the second needs bet­ter gui­tar but I quite like what I was aim­ing for. The third is my fa­vour­ite though you may want to turn down the treble. Strangely there’s a lot of gui­tar on these which is not something I thought I was do­ing much at the time.

I hope you like them. Per­haps Daniel can do some vo­cals for them five years on.
