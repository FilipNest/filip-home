Filters is a demo/concept/experiment of a decentralised social messaging platform with a focus on context. It's a bit like Twitter crossed with a chat room with the ability to have discussions on a specific topic with specific people while filtering out content you don't want based on topic, author, points (votes) the post has and more.

You can switch contexts easily by typing tags into a big context box at the top of the page but can also set default contexts and filters for yourself to only show content by specific users (or not by specific users) or content that has a certain amount of points throughout the whole system.

The decentralised bit means you can run your own copy of it (it's free and open source) and communicate with other copies.
