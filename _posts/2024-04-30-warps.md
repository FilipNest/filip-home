description: A silly little thing written for a prompt on an electronic music forum that didn't ask for anything like this

---

_I hang out on an electronic music forum a lot. There was a prompt including the word "corpse". I wrote some lyrics and followed the prompt for some music. It's silly but I wanted to update this place more often so am continuing to do so with everything I can._

## Warps

Not much rhymes with corpse because it’s dead,
Lay down your broken head and dream the dreams that corpses do,
It’s nice to look at you

I loved you for three minutes before you got into this mess
You maybe knew it for a second so I guess that’s a success
You were pretty good at talking, not too good at walking
Now be still and let them grieve
…
Don’t move until they (leave)

(Chorus)

What would people think
If I said I saw you blink…

(Chorus)
