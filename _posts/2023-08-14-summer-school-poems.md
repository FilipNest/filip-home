_Went along to the wonderful / intense Kodály Summer School (singing/musicianship). Felt a bit sad / useless one night and then wrote a lot of poems. Here are a few. Only one is related to this feeling._  

_The Pumpkin is related to a pumpkin that was left rotting on a windowsill for a very very long time I walked by every day_

## Empty chairs, crowded stage

For a moment I become you.
I'm in your shoes and they fit.
My seat empties while I touch the stage,
but just for a little bit.

You're young and I feel younger.
Your eyes as bright as mine.
With the same dreams and ambitions, only at a different time.

"You can do it when you want to"
"You've got so much choice ahead"
And so many paths to dreaming,
Chose the easy one instead.

The stage isn't the biggest, but the smile you give might be,
You got it right stood under lights that'll never shine for me.

For a moment I become you, see your teacher's guiding stares, and then see souls becoming you from a hundred other chairs.

I hear a voice beside me "that was great", then "shall we go?",
And our applause was only yours, and our moment just a show.

By the stage door for a second more I'm with you til you blink,
For a moment I became you and was happier, I think.

## A Fighting Love

Ours is a fighting love
Oh ours is a fighting love
It's always growls and hissing
But I'd rather just be kissing you
Why is ours always a fighting love?

It always ends in sorrys and then hugs,
It always ends in sorrys and then hugs.
We act like thugs not heartstring tugs,
I'd rather just be kissing you.
And I'd rather lose the sorrys keep the hugs.

It's always whirlwinds flying through the room.
It's always whirlwinds flying through the room.
The devil's doom the witches broom,
I'd rather just be kissing you.
And be shelter not a whirlwind in the room.

## The Pumpkin

A book from off the shelf,
That no one ever chooses.
Its cover's not itself,
Despite the make-up that it uses.

A fairy tale collection pops a spell I change complextion
And I look the part, through some dark art? I've got no recollection.

A quick transfiguration, a nice dress, imagination
And I'm happy among friends and they can tell.
But I leave the celebration to a midnight dampened station
And hear shouts and taunts and laughter as they break right through the spell.

A bit of temporary magic, a little finger snap,
It was beautiful til midnight now it's back to feeling crap.

The summer it was dreadful more than I could take.
Stuck inside a costume that I tried but couldn't shake.

Still when it's dark I am myself.
Not as I'm always seen.
But then I'm back onto a shelf 
a pumpkin after halloween.

I'm here, I'm here, I'm here can you hear me?
Take a glimpse beneath the skin.
I'm me, I'm me, I'm me can you see it?
Not the cover I was born with but the pages tucked within.

Spells and imagination they made me feel OK,
Dressed in beautiful things til they cut all the strings and take everything away.

If I sing, if I sing, if I sing will you hear me?
I can't sing but I'll close my eyes and try.
On your commute, I don't refute this costume's not a friendly suit
But I still shout out as you shrug and pass on by.

I'm here, I'm here, I'm here can you hear me?
Take a glimpse beneath the skin.
I'm me, I'm me, I'm me can you see it?
Not the way I look to everyone but how I feel within.

## I'd hate to lose you

Everyone keeps saying we should try it.
You look at me and keep on wondering "when?".
I see those eyes all occupied with love but none comes back to you,
When I think of how I'd screw it up "what then?"

We go out and it is always just us laughing,
We click but never stick it's there then not.
Alone, 
and you think "here's the chance!", 
but never a returning glance,
Rather hurt a friend a little, 
Than hurt one true love a lot.

You grab me and you say it,
But I flee into the night,
I'd hate to lose you as a friend
I'm thinking that I might.
