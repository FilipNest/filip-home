Two Halloween EPs of stories/songs that I performed at the Rising Sun Arts Centre in August and October this year. They cover disaster, vampires, lake monsters, mental health, a traffic light party, self-driving lorries, a baby, bears and voodoo dolls.

Fol­low­ing last year’s Hal­loween EP of songs per­formed at the Here Comes the Sun Fest­ival at the Rising Sun Arts Centre in Read­ing, here are two EPs of songs and stor­ies for Hal­loween 2014. The first half was ori­gin­ally per­formed at the Here Comes the Sun Fest­ival in Au­gust this year and the second at the same venue on Oc­to­ber 18th. All were home re­cor­ded over the last few days of Oc­to­ber 2014 at Stu­dio Josephine, Ab­bey Road, St John’s Wood.

Top­ics covered are: Dis­aster, vam­pires, lake mon­sters, men­tal health, a traffic light party, self-driv­ing lor­ries, a baby, bears and voo­doo dolls.

They are ded­ic­ated to the traffic, birds and other noises on Ab­bey Road that make them­selves known even at 3am. You prob­ably don’t need to read that ded­ic­a­tion as they’re all over the re­cord.

I used three acous­tic gui­tars (an Ad­mira nylon string, Cath­er­ine the Ibanez steel string and a Yamaha Pa­ci­fica elec­tric), a Ca­sio di­gital pi­ano, an MV8800 Pro­duc­tion Stu­dio, a Zoom H4N field re­corder and a Shure SM57 mi­cro­phone. The birds on “No Bears” were ori­gin­ally re­cor­ded many years ago at Cherry Croft, Wel­wyn Garden City.

Thank you to every­one who went to these shows or put the shows on in the first place (without shows to play I’d never have writ­ten these songs).

Have a Happy Hal­loween (the greatest hol­i­day of the year).
