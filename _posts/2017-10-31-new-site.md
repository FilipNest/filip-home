I usually launch some art projects for Halloween but this year (2017) has been a quiet one of aggregating and looking back. Hence my [...Any Requests?](this-is-my-first-time-any-requests) music compilation and this new website.

The last one was wonderful and side scrolling but the experiment in side scrolling was a bit of an attack on usability so I've gone away from it here.

It's very new so please let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.

The random colours aren't directly powered by the ColourLovers API anymore but are generated in this site. I might tweak how they work over time as they're not as fun as before.

The main reason for the new site is to have a place to blog more frequently. It's powered by Jekyll (Happy Halloween) so should be easy enough to update. Especially looking forward to moving some of my threaded Twitter mind-dumps about music onto here. I used to write a lot of music reviews in various places, even running my own art publication for a few years and want to get back into it.

While on music, the hassle of tagging and re-uploading my music into whatever format I wanted for the web made me build a static music site builder based on ID3 tags (including images). This way I have a good reason to tag my music properly and can deploy it to a structured web playlist easily. [More about the open source music box project here](https://github.com/FilipNest/musicbox).

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy the site.

Here's a picture of the old one (the bubbles were clickable, might as well reveal that hidden feature now):
