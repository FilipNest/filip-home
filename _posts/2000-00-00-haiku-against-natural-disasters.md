## Haiku against Avalanches, Blizzards (and other cold things that cause pain)

Dear avalanches,
Blizzards and other cold things
that cause pain.  Please end.

## Haiku against Earthquakes

Earthquakes shake the earth
The earth is not a rattle
Earthquakes please be still.

## Haiku against Tornadoes

Huff puff blow twist ouch
Tornadoes please divide, split
Let us fly our kites.

## Haiku against Tsunamis

To stop Tsunamis
Become your own tsunami
Stop to teach others.

## Haiku against volcanoes

Simple volcanoes
Cause complicated problems
Poetry should help.
