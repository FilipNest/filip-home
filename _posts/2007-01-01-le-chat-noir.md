_Part of a series where when I got a random band follow request on MySpace (happened a lot) I wrote a poem with their name_

It gets colder here the further South we go
This isn't home
And I don't like it
Broken cottages,
A friend who's turning blind.

Le Chat Noir, a place to hide
From sorrows, footsteps, progress
I pictured hell just for a second
And it evolved within my mind.

A path to walk all through the morning,
A clearing filled with sticks at night.
The birds don't sing for us this far.
Discarded all hope that they might.

Eyes closed tightly just to stop us
Reaching out or turning home
It got warmer as I opened once
And found myself alone.

Feeling playful, free and stupid
Clear of what we came to find.
Walking round in ditzy circles
As my friends lay dead behind.

A sword Le Chat Noir, a home
To pass on information.
And join up with each other group
In gleeful hibernation.
