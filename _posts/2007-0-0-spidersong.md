You took hours to get ready,
We were standing by the door.
You came running upstairs screaming:
"There's a spider on the bathroom floor"
We laughed.

Two of our group went down to look.
We never saw them alive again.
And now I'm here
Clutching in my right arm the right arm of a friend I knew
It's quite a mess.
I've got pest control on the other line saying, "no,
we only do earthly pests"

Now I'm looking in its eyes
and it's looking rather peaceful so I ask it:

"Just what are you planning to do?"

And it says (after a three second pause to rest)
"ohâ€¦ I'm so madly in love with you"
"Is that a fact?"
"I guess"
"Then why'd you eat all of my friends"
"Friends are nothing compared to the love we'll have"
It said they're nothing, compared to the love we'll have.

And then it did a little keyboard solo.
Which isn't too hard when you've got eight limbs.

Now I'm standing in the aisle and thinking
Though I've always hated spiders
She's kinda sexy when she's shaved her legs.

We'll have children and they'll all be freaks
The doctor says they're due in a couple of weeks
And I'm someone, we've a web for a flat,
It's always tidy, there's a view and a cat
That likes us.

My new friends are wearing silk
Until they promptly disappear.
I've never felt like I do now
But wish I were out of here
To a bathroom with a mop and some spray
We've had wraps for dinner just about every day.

And she's four times the hassle in bed,
Has a slightly uneven though just about loveable circular head
Is spineless but not without heart.

Sometimes I ask if it's worth it and say
"Perhaps not" but I'd rather not be pulled away
From the table all chewed up and rolled up and lonely
and dead lying lifeless and loveless and friendless and heartless and
still and all broken apart.
