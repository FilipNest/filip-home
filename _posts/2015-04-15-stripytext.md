Stripytext is a little bit of JavaScript that gives your HTML fonts stripes without the use of images, SVG, canvas or such. It should work with any font/style. You choose the amount of stripes and the colours (feel free to go epic and use it for making gradients). You should even be able to animate the stripes using CSS transitions or whatever else you want just by targetting them with CSS or JavaScript. The stripes will scale with the font size dynamically and shouldn't get lost if you do CSS transforms or other things to them. The extra HTML bits that are added to make the stripes are hidden for users of screenreaders as it'd be annoying if they weren't.
