Four songs and rough recordings made as part of an epic choose your own adventure birthday present for David Turner which was presented by his girlfriend Christy Harrington-Brown.

In May 2013, my friend Christy Har­ring­ton-Brown staged pos­sibly the most epic birth­day present pos­sible for her boy­friend, my friend also, David Turner.  It was a two part, multi path choose your own ad­ven­ture game com­plete with a video news re­port, an altered group-sung chorus of There’s A Hole in My Bucket Pocket, a news­pa­per front page (which I wrote and de­signed for her), crowd­sourced videos of people tele­port­ing and this EP by me for the time-travel path.

I was ill on the dead­line so they’re very rough re­cord­ings (my Zoom H4N field re­corder was run­ning out of bat­ter­ies for the pre­lude which cre­ated a pretty amaz­ing take on lo-fi) but I’m proud of them/​the words.
