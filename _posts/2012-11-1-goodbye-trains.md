Good­bye “news”
Good­bye frowns
Shuffles, sneezes, ups and downs.

Whirr­ing, creep­ing, trem­bling, bleep­ing,
Good­bye life-snap­shots and sleep­ing.
Good­bye car­riage smell at night
Hazy vis­ion, filtered light.

A screen a book, a down­ward stare
Quick run through make-up, dress and hair.

Good­bye every­one to­gether.
​Dif­fer­ent fab­ric stitched the same.
Good­bye an­noun­cers bored of say­ing:
“We’re sorry we’ve delayed this train.”

Good­bye couples never talk­ing.
Though phone calls out are al­ways loud.
Good­bye dreams of brief en­coun­ters.
Take those seats? Are we al­lowed?

Good­bye home in end­less sta­tions,
Places passed but never grasped.
Good­bye slid­ing doors es­cap­ing
Good­bye one-track rhym­ing trains.
