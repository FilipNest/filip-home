Hi! I’m Filip Hnízdo (pro­nounced “Nest”), an ap­plic­a­tion/​web de­veloper, writer (& former news­pa­per journ­al­ist), di­gital artist, mu­si­cian and occasional trainer / mentor.

For more information about my work check out [my biography at Octophin Digital](https://octophindigital.com/about/filip).

I spend a lot of time on Twit­ter at [@filipn­est](https://twitter.com/filipnest).

You can email me at [mail@filipnest.com](mailto:mail@filipnest.com)

Why is this page styled dif­fer­ently to the rest? I wanted to keep a bit of an old site’s style go­ing.
