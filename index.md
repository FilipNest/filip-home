I'm Filip Hnízdo (pronounced "Nest").

I write [poetry](/tag/poetry), [music](#music), [stories](/tag/stories) and [computer programs](/tag/code), sometimes dabbling in other art things. I also like writing about [other people's art](/tag/art-tribute).

In professional life I'm director of [Octophin Digital](https://octophindigital.com) where we make digital things for the wildlife conservation and arts sectors.
