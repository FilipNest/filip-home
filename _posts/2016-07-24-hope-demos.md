Ten years ago today or there­abouts I re­leased my first ever EP. The Joanna Coote EP. I thought re­leas­ing something on the an­niversary would make sense so here are three songs.

The re­cord­ings are very rough and prob­ably de­serve bet­ter but dead­lines are dead­lines.

A Thought of You has been float­ing around for over a year. First I wrote the lyr­ics, then I lost the lyr­ics when my laptop broke and I pieced to­gether what I re­membered, then I found I’d ac­tu­ally re­cor­ded a demo of it when I first wrote it, then I lost that demo along with lots of other au­dio re­cord­ings. I re­cor­ded this one in one take. So it’s fi­nally out there.

There was go­ing to be a fourth song which I have been plan­ning for a while but it has been put on hold due to time con­straints. So the EP does­n’t end on a light, funny note. Sorry. Next time per­haps.
