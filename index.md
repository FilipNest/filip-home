I'm Filip Hnízdo (pronounced "Nest").

I write [poetry](/tag/poetry), [music](#music), [stories](/tag/stories) and [interactive web art focused on colours, music and geolocation](/tag/code). I also like writing about [other people's art](/tag/art-tribute).

In professional life I'm director of [Octophin Digital](https://octophindigital.com) where we make digital things like interactive maps, games, apps and databases for the wildlife conservation and arts sectors.
